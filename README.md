# Optica Web Application
The full stack MERN application that helps to enter simple manufacturing forms.

I used the following technologies to build this app:
- Bulit backend API with node.js & express, connecting MySQL server
- Protecting routes/endpoints with JWT(JSON web tokens)
- Testing API with Postman
- Integreating React with the backend
- Using Redux for app state management
- Creating reducers and actions for the resources
- Testing with the redux Chrome extension
- Deploying to Heroku using Git
